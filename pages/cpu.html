Before we dive into writing instructions for the CPU, let’s take a moment to understand how it all works.
Since 1945, computers have been built on the Von Neumann Architecture, which looks like this:

<pre class="ascii-title">
+-------+        +-----+        +--------+
|       |        |     |        |        |
| Input |<------>| CPU |<------>| Output |
|       |        |     |        |        |
+-------+        +-----+        +--------+
                    ^
                    ▓
                    ▓
                    ▓
                    V
                 +-----+
                 |     |
                 |     |
                 |     |
                 | RAM |
                 |     |
                 |     |
                 |     |
                 +-----+
</pre>
As you can see, it’s really quite straightforward, we just break everything down into smaller pieces.
Before the Von Neumann architecture came along, everything was a single, massive unit.
So, if you wanted to run another program, you had to rebuild the whole thing from scratch.
Now that we’ve split things up, we can make the most of the CPU and use it as much as we need.

Now let's look to how our CPU looks like inside:

<pre class="ascii-title">

Sure, I’ve simplified a few things, but generally, a CPU looks something like this.
It consists of cores, which include registers, cache, a Control Unit (CU), and an Arithmetic Unit (AU).
Everything is linked through the L2 cache.

* Registers are small but incredibly fast memory units. In x86-64 architecture, we can store 64-bit numbers.
* L1 Cache is another type of memory that’s slower than registers but it's bigger. We don’t have direct access to it.
* The Control Unit is in charge of executing instructions.
* The Arithmetic Logic Unit handles all the arithmetic operations.
* L2 Cache serves the core pairs. It's biggger than L1 Cache but slower.
